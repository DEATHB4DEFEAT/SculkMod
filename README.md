# Hello

This is a datapack for the Origins mod that adds a new origin, the Warden.
This is a work in progress, though is completely usable and *probably* balanced.
I plan on adding a third origin, the Sculkling, which will be a weaker impact two version of the Warden, maybe even making that the starting origin of which you evo into the warden.

## <img src="./images/yellow.png" height="16" /> Sculkling

Selectable as an impact 2 starting origin

```diff
- The sun will "burn" you
+ Can spread the sculk at the cost of experience
- Very small, 1 block tall
- 50% less attack damage
- 30% less health (7 hearts)
+ Wardens will not attack you, no matter what
- Carnivorous
+ Immune to all fire damage
= Spawn in an ancient city
- Can't wear any armor (can wear cosmetics/elytra)
- Can't sleep, but can set spawn
+ Don't activate sculk sensors unless standing on them
- Blind
+ Dig through sculk and gain a 1.5x speed boost, while doing so you are completely invisible
+ While inside a sculk block you regenerate 1 heart every 2 seconds
+ Being within 8 blocks of a sculk sensor will grant you the effects of the sonic pulse ability detailed below
+ Every 10 seconds, can send a "sonic pulse" to unblind self and give night vision for 2.5 seconds
+ Show a glow effect around anything not crouching within a 10-block radius of you

- Being too far from any sort of sculk will give you negative effects depending on the distance
```
